## What

Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) is an influential early
time-sharing operating system, based around the concept of a single-level memory.
Virtually all modern operating systems are heavily influenced by Multics; often
through Unix, either directly (Linux, macOS) or indirectly (Microsoft Windows).

## Influence

The design and features of Multics greatly influenced the Unix operating system,
which was originally written by two Multics programmers, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.
Superficial influence of Multics on Unix is evident in many areas, including the
naming of some commands. But the internal design philosophy was quite different,
focusing on keeping the system small and simple, and so correcting some deficiencies
of Multics because of its high resource demands on the limited computer hardware of the time.

The name Unix (originally Unics) is itself a pun on Multics. The U in Unix is rumored
to stand for uniplexed as opposed to the multiplexed of Multics, further underscoring the
designers' rejections of Multics' complexity in favor of a more straightforward
and workable approach for smaller computers. (Garfinkel and Abelson cite an alternative
origin: Peter Neumann at Bell Labs, watching a demonstration of the prototype,
suggested the name/pun UNICS (pronounced "Eunuchs"), as a "castrated Multics", although
Dennis Ritchie is claimed to have denied this.)

Ken Thompson, in a transcribed 2007 interview with Peter Seibel refers to Multics
as "...overdesigned and overbuilt and over everything. It was close to unusable.
They (i.e., Massachusetts Institute of Technology) still claim it’s a monstrous success,
but it just clearly wasn't." He admits, however, that "the things that I liked enough
(about Multics) to actually take were the hierarchical file system and the shell—a separate
process that you can replace with some other process."
